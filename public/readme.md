# To Do

-Fix scramjet in terms of when opening a site, it attempts to take you to {underglow}/scramjet/{googlesearch} rather than opening it within the iframe

-Fix rammerhead | Current error: ```An error occurred: unexpected server response to not match "200". Server says "The page could not be found NOT_FOUND cle1::gk5dm-1743798541994-ecfaedbcb386 "``` This is a vercel 404 error, and likely just requires a package.json and/or vercel.json or edits to server.js
