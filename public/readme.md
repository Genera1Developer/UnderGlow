# To Do

# FIRST
-Fix UV Search | Currently getting error 404 when searching, 404 in uv/gp/{google search}

-Fix UV Direct Links | Current error:  ```RangeError: Failed to construct 'Response': The status provided (0) is outside the range [200, 599].```

## Second
Once finished with UV:

-Fix scramjet in terms of when opening a site, it attempts to take you to {underglow}/scramjet/{googlesearch} rather than opening it within the iframe

-Fix rammerhead | Current error: ```An error occurred: unexpected server response to not match "200". Server says "The page could not be found NOT_FOUND cle1::gk5dm-1743798541994-ecfaedbcb386 "``` This is a vercel error, and likely just requires a package.json and/or vercel.json
